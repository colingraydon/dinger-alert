This project is intended to analyze an audio wave and determine what song the wave originates from.

A wave is analyzed as input, broken into a byte array, a fast fourier transform is applied to it. After, the frequency with the highest magnitude in certain ranges is hashed into a fingerprint - 1 fingerprint per second of the song. It is then compared against other hashed full songs in the database, which will be collected from local .wav files.
